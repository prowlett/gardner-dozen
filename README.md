# A Gardner's Dozen in TikZ

Martin Gardner's long-running column in *Scientific American* made it onto the front cover of the magazine twelve times. Gathering 4 Gardner refers to these cover stories as "[A Gardner's Dozen](https://martin-gardner.org/SciAm12.html)", while pointing out that these aren't his 'greatest hits' and the magazine artists didn't necessarily reproduce the graphics as he would have liked them. 

Nevertheless, I thought it would be a fun challenge to try to reproduce these in TikZ, a drawing package for LaTeX. I like TikZ, and appreciate a chance to practice my skills. Readers of the future will be able to judge how many of the dozen I produced, or how regularly I did these.
